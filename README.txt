- the numerical results for unconstrained optimization problems, in which contain four tables.


Unconstrained_optimization_problems        
- implementation of two groups of experiments for unconstrained  optimization problems.

The_first_group       
- implementation of the first group, in which the runcode is the MATLAB source code demo_CGM.m

The_second_group       
- implementation of the second group, in which the runcode is also the MATLAB source code demo_CGM.m


Image_restoration_problems       
- implementation of  the proposed FHTTCGM-N, HZ and PRPs for image restoration problems, in which the runcode is the MATLAB source code demo.m


Implementation and numerical experience with the above codes are described in the paper:
